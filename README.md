# WEB-SOBA
WEB-SOBA is a method for word embeddings-based semi-automatic ontology Building. This ontology can then be used for aspect based sentiment classification
To use it on another domain other than restaurants you first have to train new word2vec vectors on the new domain and then use this new model in the ontology builder.

However if you want to use it for the restaurant domain, you can download the required large files not suited for github using the follow google drive: https://drive.google.com/open?id=19kkxN64GVWqnPKVcCy6a5JseRRb26usu
Just add these files to the externalData folder.
